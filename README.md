## Build Instructions
this is my own ideal way to develop OverEngine:
### On Windows
On Windows, I use `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` to generate project files for Visual Studio 2019 using Premake. Premake's VS project generator is fast and clean.

### On Linux
On Linux I prefer using `CMake` because it is just better and cleaner than `premake`'s `gmake2` generator.
You can use any generator but `Ninja` and `Unix Makefiles` generators are my favorite ones.
```bash
# we are in project's root directory
# 'mkdir build' is not needed
# run this command:
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
# or this one (not both)
cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"

# To build
cmake --build build
# or (not both)
cd build
ninja
```

## IDE / Build tool - platform - compiler support
* Visual Studio 2019 - Windows - MSVC
* CMake (with make or ninja) - Linux - GCC / G++
